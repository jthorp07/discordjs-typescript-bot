## Setups & Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, it is recommended to already have experience using Typescript, Javascript, the Node.js runtime, and npm. Additionally, this tutorial will not go over the process of creating a bot application on the Discord Developer Portal. The beginning of this tutorial assumes that you already have an appropriate version of Node.js installed, and that you already have a bot token and client ready for use.

In this tutorial, we'll go from having only a token and husk of a bot user to having a discord bot that can handle some basic commands.
